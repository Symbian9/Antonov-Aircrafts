This scenario places the Shuttle launcher to KTTS

Copy the file:   Shuttel-Launcher.xml

to your Flightgear/AI folder,
then you may activate it in the scenario menue.

3D-Model is from NASA

You have to start the shuttle in this position:

Koordinates for KTTS, parking spot:
latitude   28.600 latitude
longitude -80.680 longitude
Heading: 60 degree
 
Putting the shuttle on top needs a 90 degree change to the FDM, so it will not work now.
Feel free to implement it!
